		<h1>Hi there!</h1>
		<p>I am an aspiring product designer from Cornell, interested in the intersections of storytelling, art and technology. I am majoring in Information Science, concentrating in UX, with a Game Design minor.</p>
		<p>I served as the Editor in Chief of The Cornell Daily Sun, where I led the design and development direction of several interactive articles. I am also a Teaching Assistant for a web design and programming course on campus. My favorite things are my Wacom tablet and good coffee :).</p>
